According to the IAB & Media Rating Council, the term ad viewability is the percentage of total ad impressions considered viewable if these two criteria are met.

1. Display ads – At least for 1 second, 50% of the ad’s pixels are visible.
2. Video ads – At least 2 seconds, 50% of the ad is visible.

Why should publishers care? Simple. To generate more revenue! If your ad space has a high viewability score, it will automatically be more valuable to advertisers. You are improving your authority to charge a better premium price for specific spots.

## Do you know why Ads Lose Viewability?

Ad viewability is a moderately new concept in digital advertising. Nevertheless, it has become a buzzword ever since. There are five main reasons why ads lose their viewability:

1.  Ad blockers used by users to avoid intrusive ads negatively impacts your viewability score
2.  Bot or Non-human Traffic may generate immersion, but the viewability score diminishes
3.  Poor placement of the ads
4.  The loading speed can increase the Bounce Rate
5.  Too High ATF or BTF (Above or Below-the-Fold) ad placement

Now, the question arises about improving ad viewability for the publishers. As there is such a high Return-on-Investment (ROI) associated with improved viewability, it’s in the best interest of publishers to prioritize the visibility of their ads.

## Here’s how you can improve your ad viewability

1.  Correct ad placement by placing your ads above the fold (ATF)
2.  Optimizing your Ad Sizes to perform better on mobile and desktop
3.  Intensifying Page load speed
4.  Reduce Your Bounce Rate by figuring out why users leave your page without interacting with it
5.  Always consider Lazy Loading
6.  Consider the usage of Sticky Ads and go ahead with AdSparc’s AdSuite

## How to Measure Ad Viewability?

As mentioned earlier, the [MRC](http://mediaratingcouncil.org/) (Media Rating Council) has a set of viewability definitions and standards for publishers and advertisers, respectively. Let’s have a quick recap on what it takes for an ad to be considered viewable:

- Display ads (Desktop) need a minimum of 50% of the ad view for at least 1 second
- Video ads (Desktop) need a minimum of 50% of pixels in view for at least 2 second
- Ad units (Desktop) need a minimum of 30% of pixels in view for at least 1 second

The MRC has also recommended the same viewability standards for mobile devices. Although viewability standards are persistently under advancement, there aren’t yet any reliable standards related to custom ad units for mobile ads.
