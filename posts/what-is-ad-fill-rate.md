## What is Ad Fill Rate?

### Introduction

Modern-day websites are attractive digital constructs that relay pertinent information to the visitors while maximizing their user experience. The primary objective of any website is to increase traffic and page ranking.

One of the most common strategies used by website owners (publishers) to help increase their site performance is advertising. Advertisers are always on the lookout for advertising space where they can place their ads to reach the right audience, while publishers are always on the lookout for ads to help fill the space on their website; thus the relationship is formed.

Advertisers pay publishers based on the number of impressions (the number of times an ad is viewed) or the number of clicks an ad receives. In turn, publishers try to ensure that the ad content is somewhat relevant to their website and user, while simultaneously ensuring that the ad does not disrupt the user’s experience in any way.
